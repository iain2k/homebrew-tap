# homebrew-tap

Add this tap to [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh) using.

`brew tap iain2k/tap`

## Formulas

**sshpass** 

This formula installs [sshpass](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sshpass) as HomeBrew disables this Formula for valid security reasons.  I use it purely to bootstrap hosts using [Ansible](https://ansible.com)

> brew -v install sshpass

`brew -v install sshpass`
